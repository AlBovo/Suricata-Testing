S is the main router and sniffs the forwarded packets to find potential threats using suricata. The ruleset is defined in custom.rules and to use it you need to decomment "suricata-update" in start.sh.

## GUI
The gui is accessible at http://localhost:3000

The data is from ElasticSearch, so to make the dashboard you have to make a new connection to an ElasticSearch origin (http://elasticsearch:9200) and create the dashboard from there.
